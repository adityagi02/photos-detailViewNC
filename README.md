# Photos App Detail Bottom Sheet


This GitHub repository contains SwiftUI code for creating a view similar to the Apple Photos app's Media Detail View Bottom Sheet. This view provides a sleek and intuitive user interface for displaying media details and interacting with it, just like the Photos app. I made it for NextCloud App, but someone made and implemented itðŸ˜«. So putting it PUBLIC!!
